## ***Stay tuned! Registration information and schedule coming soon.***

<br/>
Keystone DH is a network of institutions and practitioners committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy across the Mid-Atlantic. This year, the Keystone DH conference will be hosted virtually by **Temple University’s Charles Library on July 15-16th, 2021**.

<br/>
Registration for Keystone DH 2021 will be *free*.

<br/>
Proposals for this years’ virtual conference are welcome on any aspect of digital technologies and their application to the humanities and/or social sciences. We encourage projects that focus on the collaborative nature of research and teaching. Senior scholars should foreground the labor of students, librarians, and/or the communities that sustained the project. We will prioritize proposals with representative and inclusive speaker involvement.

Questions? Feel free to contact us at **contact@keystonedh.network**.
