Dr. Trettien specializes in the history of text technologies and has a forthcoming book with the University of Minnesota Press, *Cut/Copy/Paste*, that brings digital humanities and media studies approaches to bear on the use of fragmented texts in early modern "makerspaces." Her other work includes [*Provoke*](http://soundboxproject.com/), a web-based collection of sound studies scholarship, and chapters and articles in *Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies*, *Humanities and the Digital*, and *Digital Humanities Quarterly*.
