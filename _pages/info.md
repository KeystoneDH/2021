## Code of Conduct ##

The Pennsylvania State University values inclusion as a core strength and an essential element of our public service mission and we strive to foster and maintain a safe environment of respect and inclusion for faculty, staff, students, guests, and members of the communities we serve. As your hosts, we want the Keystone DH conference to be welcoming, supportive, and comfortable for all participants. We will not tolerate harassment of conference participants and anyone engaging in harassment (including sustained disruptive behavior, inappropriate or unwelcome physical contact, intimidation, and offensive comments related to race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, or other protected class status) will be warned and may be asked to leave. **If you are experiencing harassment, please report it to one of the conference organizers.**

## Facilities ##
There are bathrooms on each floor by the elevators and there are water fountains nearby. There is a bottle filling station down the hall on the right (just before you get to the Arts & Architecture Library entrance). Rooms 102-103 & 106 can be used as quiet spaces and there are also sitting areas around the floor and outside.

## Food ##
We will be providing breakfast on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings and providing lunch on Tuesday. In the afternoon, if you want to get a snack or coffee, there are two Au Bon Pain locations nearby: in the Zoeller Visual Arts Building (next to the Palmer Art Museum on Curtin Rd.) and in the Kern Graduate Building (about two blocks west, behind the Pattee bus station). A little further afield, there are other food options and a Starbucks in the [HUB](https://foodservices.psu.edu/hub-dining-options-hours) on Pollock Road, about a 10 minute walk south of here.

## Campus Bus Service ##
There is regular campus bus service at Penn State, which you can also use to get to College and Beaver Aves. downtown. [Maps and schedules are online](https://www.catabus.com/ServiceSchedules/CATABUS/CampusService/Schedule/Web/blueloop.html) and the service is free.
