## Presenter Guidelines

For Keystone DH 2021, events will take place in a series of virtual formats.

Presentations may take the form of short papers, panel discussions or roundtables, workshops, poster sessions, or showcase demonstrations. 

### General Guidelines

All presentation sessions are 1.25 hours long. Panels, roundtables, and workshops will take place on Zoom. The Keystone Organizational Committee will set up Zoom meetings for each session, with presenters assigned as co-hosts. Technical hosts and moderators will be available to facilitate each session. 

Please keep in mind that presentations and documents are expected to meet [accessibility guidelines](https://www.diglib.org/dlf-events/2016forum/guide-to-creating-accessible-presentations/). In addition, presenters and attendees must agree to follow the conferenceâ€™s [Code of Conduct](/code).

For further guidelines on preparing an accessible slideshow or recording your presentation, see Temple's guidelines. 

### Presentation Format Guidelines

#### Panels/Short Papers

Papers will be allotted 15 minutes, while all discussions will take place over 1.25 hours. Approximately 15-20 minutes will be reserved for Live Q&A. 

Paper presenter can choose to pre-record their presentations. The organizers' preference is for presentations to be live. 

#### Roundtables 

Roundtables can take a more open discussion format if the organizers prefer.  

#### Workshops

Workshop presentations are expected to be live. Please coordinate with the organizers of the conference with any specific technical requests or issues with your workshop. 

#### Digital Showcase

Your session will occur on Gather.io, and you will have visitors come to your designated area of the virtual space to attend your poster session. You should plan to be there live, but have the choice of playing a pre-recorded lightning talk or showing a poster or slideshow and answering questions as visitors arrive.
